Hi, my name is Brian Semrau.

I'm a software developer from Michigan who likes to dabble in a little bit of everything.

I started programming when I was 11 with an interest in making games. I've spent time working on robotics, automotive driver assistance, fluid simulation, and machine learning/AI.

I'm most proud of my time at [Winterpixel Games](https://www.winterpixel.com) where I helped ship Rocket Bot Royale and started the development on Goober Dash.
